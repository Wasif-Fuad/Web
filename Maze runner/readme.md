This is a visualization project . It genarates a maze Using BFS/DFS and also tries to Solve them using the same algorithms .
So it will help you understant better how these two algorithms work.

P.S. 
1. Watch the maze solving part for better under standing of the algorithms . Though both maze generation and solving are  using the same algorithms , 
they are used a little differently while generating the maze.
2. Increase the frame rate to Slow down the operations .
3. While solving , the bfs search doesnt look for optimal path .
